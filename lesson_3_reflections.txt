When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local? 
A remote repository is best when working in a group setting with changes compiled in parallel branches and collaborated into
a main.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes changes like commits aren't monumental and would only clutter or confuse your repositories. And you want an organized repository
outlined into thoughts. Thereby allowing easier demarcs to be created.
