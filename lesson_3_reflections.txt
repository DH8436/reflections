When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local? 
A remote repository is best when working in a group setting with changes compiled in parallel branches and collaborated into
a main.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes changes like commits aren't monumental and would only clutter or confuse your repositories. And you want an organized repository
outlined into thoughts. Thereby allowing easier demarcs to be created.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another.
A fork is a clone of a repository on GitHub copied your your GitHub, a clone is a copy on either a local to local or Git to Git, a branch is a divergent program copying certain commits at a certain stage of a program creating a new commit.
Forks - for copying a giving create to a repository
Clones - for copy to copy
Branch for writing or modifying within that specific program.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So even if you're offline you will working on the last state which can be combined or merged with
the latest once connectivity is restored.
