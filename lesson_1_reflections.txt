How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The command told me exactly where to look

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    1st you see the changes and can help you in larger coding sets to pinpoint the changes, 
    cutting down debugging time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have a better recollect of why you were saving at that particular point.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because multiple files can make up one version while separating every files causing 
    you to have to compare files ... i don't really know why

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I know diff to view the differences I don't know git log. Log how many times you saved

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always go back to an earlier commit and compare. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Machine learning yes something like that
